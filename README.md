# 🌾 Teman Petani – Open Source Assistant for Farmers

**Teman Petani** is an open-source initiative to help farmers manage their daily crop care routines more efficiently and sustainably.

This project began with a simple goal:  
💡 _"To give farmers — especially in rural areas — an intuitive, mobile-friendly tool to schedule fertilizing, track growth, and improve yields, without needing to be tech-savvy."_

---

## 📱 Our Vision

Imagine a lightweight Android app that:
- Sends timely notifications for fertilizing and crop care
- Supports multiple plant types (e.g., rice, chili, lettuce, pakcoy)
- Works **offline**
- Is **free and open source**
- Has **minimal ads** (just enough for a cup of coffee ☕)

We're building it one step at a time — and you’re invited.

## 🤝 We Welcome Contributors!

We’re actively looking for developers, designers, writers, and agriculture enthusiasts to help us:

- 🛠 Build the Android frontend (Java/Kotlin/Flutter)
- 🔄 Improve the backend (Python, Flask/FastAPI)
- 🌍 Translate the app into local languages
- 📚 Add farming knowledge and fertilizer logic
- 🧪 Write tests and automate deployments
- 🎨 Polish the UI and user experience

No contribution is too small!

## 🛠 Tech Stack (so far)

- Python 3.10+
- Flask (or FastAPI planned)
- SQLite / JSON-based prototype
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) + CustomTkinter (for prototype GUI)
- Android frontend to be built (open to framework proposals)

## 🧑‍🌾 Why Open Source?

Because farmers deserve accessible, transparent, and sustainable technology.  
And because we believe in **learning together**, building tools that matter, and empowering others.
